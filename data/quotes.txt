I see you've asked whether the Evo Witch would survive Hiroshima... Treating a Lv 15 Evolution Witch (approx ~2500 nominal HP, high-level skeleton summoner profile) as the System Integrity Unit (SIU) being introduced into the spatiotemporal parameters of a ~15 kT TNT Equivalent Aerial DetonationBasically, that bomb threw out three main types of nastiness all at once, and none of them play nice with Clash Royale stats: The heat flash: This wasn't like... warm. Think instantly brighter than the sun, depositing enough energy in fractions of a second to vaporize stone. 2500 HP doesn't mean you can absorb infinite thermal energy. At Ground Zero? Zap. She'd turn into witch-flavored steam before she could even blink. Zero survival odds here. The massive pressure wave (blast): This wave of super-compressed air slams into everything at crazy speeds. We're talking forces that flattened buildings miles away. CR units have knockback resistance, sure, but they don't have the structural integrity of a tank to withstand multiple atmospheres of sudden pressure difference. She'd be crushed and ripped apart instantly. Another zero for survival.The radiation: Gamma rays and neutrons raining down. Stuff that messes up your insides at a cellular level within seconds/minutes out to pretty far distances. Does the Evo Witch have a radiation resistance stat? Nope. Her HP doesn't shield against radiation poisoning. Even if she somehow survived the initial heat and blast (she wouldn't), the radiation dose close in would still be 100% lethal. Another zero. Think of it this way: Her health bar is designed to withstand hits from Prince lances or Pekka swords, not instantaneous, simultaneous doses of enough heat to boil you, pressure to flatten you, and radiation to fry you from the inside out. Her evolution ability to summon more skeletons doesn't change anything either. The whole event is over in microseconds; the skeletons wouldn't even start forming before the Witch herself ceased to exist as matter in a stable state. So, placing a Clash Royale Evolution Witch into the actual peak radius of the Hiroshima blast, according to real-world physics? The chances of her walking away are mathematically indistinguishable from zero. It's like asking the Knight if he could surf a tsunami with his mustache power. Not what his stats are for. She needs a totally different kind of shield, or maybe instant teleporation before the flash. As is? Nah, the universe's physics engine gives her a hard pass. Hard. Zero. Percent. Survival. RIP Witch.
